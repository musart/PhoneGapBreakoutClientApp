These are mobile applications for breakout.js client.
One is Android, the other is iOS.

Android is using websocket plugin because Android doesn't support 
WebSocket in WebView.(I tested WebSocket functionality with ICS 4.0.4 on Galaxy S)

iOS is not using websocket plugin. WebSocket in UIWebView is working fine.
(I tested WebSocket functionality with iOS 5.1 on iPhone 4GS)
